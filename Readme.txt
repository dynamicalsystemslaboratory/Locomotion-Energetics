figure2.mx Example walking trajectory in the sagittal plane.
figure3.mx Extent of the feasibility region for changing initial conditions and model
parameters.
figure4.mx Non-dimensional gait metrics plotted over the feasibility region as functions
of the parameters $\gamma$ and $\varphi$
figure6.mx Comparison between experimental trends describing forward speed versus
step length (a,d) and step frequency (b,e), with superimposed predictions from the
rescaled sagittal plane model [29].
